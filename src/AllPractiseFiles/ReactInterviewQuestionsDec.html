-hooks in react? name few hooks?
In React, hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state, side effects, and other React
features that were previously only available in class components. Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8
-Custom Hooks:
A custom hook is a function that uses other hooks to provide a specific piece of functionality.
-Rules of Hooks:
Hooks must be called at the top level of the functional component or custom hook
(not inside loops or conditions).
Hooks must be called from functional components or custom hooks (not regular JavaScript functions).
-React.memo()
React.memo() is a HOC that memoizes the rendering of a functional component.
It is used to prevent unnecessary renders of a component when its props remain the same.
It performs a shallow comparison of the props to determine whether the component needs to be re-rendered.
const MyComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
// Component logic
return <div>{data}</div>;
});
-shallow comparison vs deep comparison in js and in react?????????????
-usememo vs usecallback
Use useCallback when you want to memoize a function, especially when passing it as a prop to child components.
In React, functional components are re-evaluated on every render. This means that the entire function body
is executed again when the component re-renders.
As a result, any functions defined within the component are recreated on each render.
import React, { useState } from 'react';
const MyComponent = () => {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// This function is recreated on every render
const handleClick = () => {
setCount(count + 1);
};
return (
<div>
  <p>Count: {count}</p>
  <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
</div>
);
};
In the example above, handleClick is a new function created on each render. This isn't always a problem, but if
you pass this function as a prop to child
components, it could trigger unnecessary re-renders in those child components.
This is where useCallback comes in handy. It memoizes the function, so it only creates a new function reference
when the dependencies change.
Here's an example using useCallback:
Copy code
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// This function is memoized and only recreated when `count` changes
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
setCount(count + 1);
}, [count]);

return (
<div>
  <p>Count: {count}</p>
  <ChildComponent handleClick={handleClick} />
</div>
);
};

const ChildComponent = ({ handleClick }) => {
// Child component receives memoized handleClick
return (
<button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
);
};

Use useMemo when you want to memoize a value, such as the result of a computation.
-So, in summary, state variables established with useState persist across re-renders, and
their values are updated based on calls to the corresponding set functions.
They don't automatically reset to their default values during each re-render.
The default values are used only during the initial render to set up the initial state.
-react lazy
React.lazy is an API for code-splitting in React. It allows you to load a React component lazily, meaning
that the component is only loaded when it's actually needed. This can help improve
the initial loading performance of your application by splitting your code into smaller chunks.
When you use React.lazy, it returns a dynamic
import() statement that fetches the component on demand. This import() statement returns a Promise.
const MyLazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'));
const MyParentComponent = () => (
<React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <MyLazyComponent />
</React.Suspense>
);
React.lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent')) returns a Promise that resolves to the module containing
the MyLazyComponent.
The component is loaded lazily only when it's needed.
The React.Suspense component is used to specify a fallback UI while the lazy component is being loaded.
So, to answer your question, the loading of a lazily loaded component using React.lazy is asynchronous.
The component is loaded in the background, and the rest of your application can continue to render and
function while the lazy component is being fetched.
It's important to note that React.lazy is designed for use with the Suspense component.
If you're using it without Suspense, it won't behave as expected. Suspense is a way to handle the loading of
asynchronous components and show fallback content while the component is loading.
-synch vs asynch
js is sync singlethreaded non-blocking language
Synchronous operations are executed one after the other in a sequential manner. Each operation must complete
before the next one starts.
In JavaScript, most operations are synchronous by default.
console.log('Start');
// Synchronous operation
function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
const result = add(2, 3);
console.log('Result:', result);
console.log('End');
//
Start
Result: 5
End
Asynchronous operations allow the program to continue executing while waiting for some task to complete.
JavaScript achieves asynchrony through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
console.log('Start');
// Asynchronous operation using setTimeout
setTimeout(() => {
console.log('Async operation completed');
}, 2000);
console.log('End');
Start
End
Async operation completed
-useeffect how not to get called first time?
If you want to skip the execution of useEffect during the initial render, you can use a simple boolean flag.
Here's a straightforward example:
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
const MyComponent = () => {
const [isInitialRender, setIsInitialRender] = useState(true);
useEffect(() => {
// Skip the effect during the initial render
if (isInitialRender) {
// Update the flag after the initial render
setIsInitialRender(false);
return;
}
// Your actual effect logic here
console.log('useEffect ran after the initial render');
}, [isInitialRender]);
return <div>Your component content here</div>;
};
export default MyComponent;
isInitialRender is a state variable that is initially set to true.
During the initial render, the useEffect is skipped by checking the value of isInitialRender.
The effect doesn't run during the initial render.
After the initial render, isInitialRender is updated to false, allowing the effect to run on subsequent renders.
-how child component can call a function defined in parent component?
// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
const ChildComponent = ({ onChildButtonClick }) => {
return (
<button onClick={onChildButtonClick}>
  Click me in the child component
</button>
);
};
export default ChildComponent;
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';
const ParentComponent = () => {
const handleChildButtonClick = () => {
console.log('Button clicked in the child component');
// You can perform any other logic here
};
return (
<div>
  <h1>Parent Component</h1>
  <ChildComponent onChildButtonClick={handleChildButtonClick} />
</div>
);
};
-parent calls child component function
it is generally not recommended for a parent component to directly call a function defined in a
child component due to the unidirectional data flow principles.
However, in certain situations, you might use a ref to access and call a
function in a child component. Here's an example demonstrating this approach:
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
const childRef = useRef(null);

const handleButtonClick = () => {
if (childRef.current) {
childRef.current.childFunction();
}
};

return (
<div>
  <ChildComponent ref={childRef} />
  <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Call Child Function</button>
</div>
);
}

// ChildComponent.jsx
import React, { forwardRef } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
const childFunction = () => {
console.log('Child function invoked!');
// Add your logic here
};

// Expose the childFunction through the ref
React.useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
childFunction,
}));

return (
<div>
  {/* Your child component UI */}
</div>
);
});

export default ChildComponent;
In this example, the useRef hook is used to create a mutable object (childRef).
This ref is passed to the ChildComponent as a prop and then assigned to the ref parameter of the forwardRef function.
The useImperativeHandle hook is used to expose the childFunction to the parent component.
Keep in mind that directly calling functions in child components from a parent component goes against the
typical React design patterns. It's usually better to lift state and functions to a common ancestor or use other
communication mechanisms like callbacks via props to maintain a
more predictable and maintainable code structure.
- state updates in React are asynchronous, and the new state may not be immediately available after calling setCount.
console.log("prev")
setCount((prev)=>prev+1)
console.log("next")
//
prev
next
console.log("next"): This line is executed immediately after the setCount line, without waiting for the state
to be updated.
It logs "next" to the console.
The useState hook returns an array with two elements:
The current state value.
A function that allows you to update the state.
-ensure next is consoled only after setcount updates state
<button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
const incrementCount = () => {
setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
};
useEffect(() => {
console.log('Count updated:', count);
console.log('next');
}, [count]);
-hoisting in js
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their
containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that regardless of where the declarations appear
in the code, they are effectively "hoisted" to the top.
Here are two common scenarios where hoisting occurs:
1.Variable Hoisting:
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
It's important to note that only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.
So, the variable is accessible but not assigned a value until the corresponding line of code is reached.
2.Function Hoisting:
sayHello(); // "Hello, World!"
function sayHello() {
console.log("Hello, World!");
}In this case, the entire function declaration function sayHello() { ... } is hoisted to the top.
Therefore, the function can be called before its actual position in the code.
1.let and const Declarations:
Unlike var, let and const declarations are hoisted to the top of their block scope, but
they are not initialized until the actual code execution reaches the declaration. This
is often referred to as the "temporal dead zone."
Accessing the variable before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 5;
console.log(x); // 5
2.Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions are expressions, and their behavior is similar to variable declarations with let and const.
They are hoisted to the top of the block scope but
are not initialized until the actual code execution reaches the declaration.
sayHello(); // TypeError: sayHello is not a function
const sayHello = () => {
console.log("Hello, World!");
};
For let and const, hoisting occurs, but accessing the variable before the declaration leads to a ReferenceError.
Arrow functions are not hoisted like regular function declarations, and trying to use them
before the declaration results in a TypeError.
-is hoisting possible on all levels in js?
Hoisting in JavaScript is applicable at the level of variable and function declarations
within their respective scopes. It is important to note that hoisting does not occur for the entire script or
block of code as a whole.
-callback?
A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after
the completion of some operation.
Callbacks are often used in scenarios like handling asynchronous tasks like
function fetchData(url, callback) {
// Simulating an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from a server)
setTimeout(() => {
const data = "This is the fetched data!";
callback(data);
}, 2000); // Simulating a 2-second delay
}
function processFetchedData(data) {
console.log("Processing data:", data);
}
// Using the fetchData function with a callback
fetchData("https://example.com/api/data", processFetchedData);
or
// Function to fetch data from an API
const fetchData = (url, callback) => {
fetch(url)
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
// Call the provided callback with the fetched data
callback(data);
})
.catch(error => {
console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
});
};

// Callback function to be executed with the fetched data
const handleData = (fetchedData) => {
setData(fetchedData);
};
// useEffect to initiate the fetch when the component mounts
useEffect(() => {
const apiUrl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1';
// Call the fetchData function with the API URL and the handleData callback
fetchData(apiUrl, handleData);
}, []);
-promise in js?
Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous operations
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an
asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
A Promise can be in one of three states:
Pending: The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
example:
To access the result of a Promise in an API call, you can use the .then() method to handle
the successful resolution of the Promise. The result of the API call will be available as an
argument to the callback function passed to .then().
Additionally, you can use the .catch() method to handle errors if the Promise is rejected.
/ Function that returns a Promise for fetching data from an API
const fetchData = () => {
return fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
.then(response => {
// Check if the response is successful (status code 2xx)
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
}
return response.json();
});
};

// Using the fetchData function
fetchData()
.then(data => {
console.log('Data:', data);
// You can use the data here
})
.catch(error => {
console.error('Error:', error);
// Handle errors here
});
using Promise keyword?
The Promise keyword is used to create a new Promise object in JavaScript.
You can use the Promise constructor to wrap asynchronous operations and handle their
results using the resolve and reject functions.
Here's an example of using the Promise keyword for an API call:
const fetchData = () => {
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
.then(response => {
// Check if the response is successful (status code 2xx)
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
}
return response.json();
})
.then(data => {
// Resolve the Promise with the fetched data
resolve(data);
})
.catch(error => {
// Reject the Promise with the error
reject(error);
});
});
};
- array of promises and one after the other execution required
If you have an array of Promises and you want to execute them one after
the other (sequentially), you can use a combination of Array.reduce and the Promise.then chain.
This ensures that each Promise is executed in sequence, and
the next Promise starts only when the previous one has resolved.
// An array of functions returning Promises
const promiseFunctions = [
() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000)),
() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 1000)),
() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 1000)),
];

// Function to execute promises sequentially
const executeSequentially = async () => {
const results = [];

for (const promiseFunction of promiseFunctions) {
const result = await promiseFunction();
results.push(result);
}

return results;
};

// Using the executeSequentially function
executeSequentially()
.then(results => {
console.log('Results:', results);
})
.catch(error => {
console.error('Error:', error);
});
The executeSequentially function uses a for...of loop to iterate over each Promise-generating function in the array.
It awaits each Promise to ensure they are executed sequentially.
The then method is used to handle the results when the Promise returned by executeSequentially resolves.
-es6 features?
classes, arrow function, modules, varialbles(let const),array methods(map),destructuring, spread opt, ternary opt.
- == && ===
Equality Operator (==):
checks for equality after performing type coercion if the operands are of different types.
It tries to convert operands to the same type before making the comparison.
console.log(5 == '5'); // true because the string '5' is coerced into a number for the comparison.
Strict Equality Operator (===):
checks for equality without performing type coercion.
console.log(5 === '5'); // false
-shallow copy and deep copy.
A shallow copy creates a new object, but it doesn't create copies of nested objects within the original object.
Instead, it copies references to those nested objects.
Shallow copies can be created using methods like Object.assign() or the spread operator (...).
// Shallow copy using Object.assign()
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, originalObject);
// Shallow copy using spread operator
const shallowCopy2 = { ...originalObject };
In the above examples, changes to b inside shallowCopy or shallowCopy2 will affect the original object's b as well.
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects within the original object.
This results in a completely independent copy.
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));
Libraries like Lodash provide _.cloneDeep() for this purpose.
// Deep copy using Lodash
const _ = require('lodash');
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const deepCopy = _.cloneDeep(originalObject);
With a deep copy, changes to b inside deepCopy will not affect the original object's b.
-display flex
default left to right
flex-direction row default column row-reverse column-reverse
flex-wrap wrap nowrap wrap-reverse
flex-flow row wrap, etc
justify-content default left to right if row , else top to bottom
align-items default top to bottom if row , else left to right
align-content along the flex line
for items:
order
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis
flex
align-self
-custom hooks return type?
No, a custom hook in React cannot directly return UI elements.
Custom hooks are primarily meant for encapsulating and sharing non-UI logic across components.
They are not intended to create or return React elements.
so mostly data
-copy object different ways? LATER...
Shallow copy creates a new object with references to the same memory locations as the original object.
This means that any changes made to the original object will be reflected in the copy.
Deep copy creates a new object with new memory locations for all of its properties and nested objects or arrays.
This means that changes made to the original object will not be reflected in the copy.
shallow copy, you can use the assign() method
const obj1 = {
a: 1,
b: 2,
};
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1);
console.log(obj2); // { a: 1, b: 2 }
deep copy, you can use the stringify() and parse() methods. The stringify() method converts an object to a
JSON string, and the parse() method converts a JSON string back to an object.
const obj1 = {
a: 1,
b: {
c: 3,
},
};
const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
console.log(obj2); // { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } }
// Cloning the Object with Spread Operator
let cloneUser = { ...userDetails };
This is no longer referenced, meaning changing the object's value will not affect the original object.
- promise.all and promise then and promise hell?
Promise.all is a method in JavaScript that takes an iterable of promises and returns a single Promise.
This new Promise resolves when all of the provided
promises in the iterable have resolved, or rejects if any of the promises are rejected.
Promise.all(iterable);
The returned promise will be fulfilled with an array of the resolved values of the input promises
(in the same order as the input). If any of the promises in the iterable reject, the
returned promise will be rejected with the reason of the first promise that was rejected.
const promise1 = Promise.resolve('Hello');
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
setTimeout(resolve, 1000, 'World');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
.then(values => {
console.log(values); // ['Hello', 42, 'World']
})
.catch(error => {
console.error(error);
});
The .then callback receives an array with the resolved values once all promises have been fulfilled.
If any promise in the array
rejects, the .catch callback will be triggered with the reason of the first rejected promise.

  console.log(true + 5)=6 -why only one dom element to be rendered in react? In React, the requirement to have a single
  parent DOM element returned from a component's render function is a rule imposed by the virtual DOM diffing algorithm
  used by React for efficient updates. When React renders a component, it creates a virtual representation of the DOM in
  memory, known as the virtual DOM. This virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. To optimize the update
  process, React needs a single root element in the virtual DOM to represent the component. which allows React to
  efficiently compare the old and new virtual DOM trees and calculate the minimum number of changes required to update
  the real DOM. If a component returns multiple top-level elements,makes it challenging for React to perform efficient
  updates, as it would need to reconcile multiple top-level elements separately. To work around this limitation,
  developers can use a common pattern called a fragment, which allows multiple elements to be returned without adding an
  extra node to the DOM. Fragments are a lightweight way to group multiple elements without introducing unnecessary
  nodes in the DOM. Here's an example: const MyComponent=()=> {
  return (
  <>
    <div>Element 1</div>
    <div>Element 2</div>
  </>
  );
  };
  -map vs filter
  map creates a new array containing the results of applying the
  provided function to each element of the original array.creating a new array with the same length.
  const newArray = array.map((element, index, array) => {
  // return transformed element
  });
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * num);
  // squaredNumbers will be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num >2);
  // [false, false, true, true, true]
  filter returns a new array with only the elements for which the provided function returns true.
  creating a new array that may have fewer elements than the original array.
  const newArray = array.filter((element, index, array) => {
  // return true to include the element in the new array
  });
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
  // evenNumbers will be [2, 4]
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  console.log( numbers.filter((num) => num *num))
  //[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  Both map and filter do not modify the original array;
  -css position
  static
  position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according
  to the normal flow of the page
  Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
  relative
  position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
  top, right, bottom, and left properties will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
  Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
  fixed
  position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the
  same place even if the page is scrolled.
  The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
  A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
  absolute
  position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
  (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed)
  However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors,
  it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
  Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
  div.relative {
  position: relative;
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
  }

  div.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 80px;
  right: 0;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
  }
  sticky
  position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
  A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
  It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the
  viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed);
  when you use position: absolute or position: fixed, the element is taken out of the normal flow, and other elements
  may be positioned as if the absolutely or fixed positioned element does not exist.
  Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
  However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first.

  -currying
  https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/currying-javascript
  Currying can be a powerful technique in JavaScript, and its usage becomes apparent in scenarios
  where partial application of functions or the creation of more specialized
  functions is beneficial. Here are a few common use cases for currying:
  1.Partial Application:
  Currying allows you to partially apply arguments to a function, creating a new
  function with some of the arguments preset.
  This can be useful in scenarios where you have a function with many parameters, and you want to
  reuse it with some default values.
  // Using currying for partial application
  function add(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
  }
  const curryAdd = curry(add);
  const add5 = curryAdd(5);
  const result = add5(3)(2); // Equivalent to add(5, 3, 2)
  console.log(result); // Output: 10
  2.Creating Specialized Functions
  -this keyword in JavaScript
  In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special keyword that refers to the current execution context or the object
  to which the current function belongs.
  The value of this is determined at runtime and depends on how a function is invoked.
  Global Context:
  When used outside of any function or object, this refers to the global object (in browsers, it's the window object).
  console.log(this === window); // Output: true
  function logThis() {
  console.log(this === window);
  }
  logThis(); // Output: true
  Function Context:
  Inside a regular function, this refers to the global object (window in browsers) or undefined in strict mode.
  Object Method:
  When a function is a method of an object, this refers to the object that owns the method.
  const person = {
  name: 'John',
  sayHello: function() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
  }
  };
  person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John!
  Constructor Function:
  When a function is used as a constructor with the new keyword, this refers to the newly created instance of the
  object.
  function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
  }
  const myDog = new Dog('Buddy');
  console.log(myDog.name); // Output: Buddy
  Event Handlers:
  In event handlers, this often refers to the element that triggered the event.
  const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this); // Output: <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
  });
  Arrow Functions:
  Arrow functions do not have their own this. They inherit the this value from the enclosing scope.
  const obj = {
  data: 10,
  fetchData: function() {
  setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(this.data);
  }, 1000);
  }
  };
  obj.fetchData(); // Output: 10
  The value of this can be explicitly set using methods like call, apply, or bind
  to control the context in which a function is executed.

  -Math.max(n1, n2,...) .min
  returns the number with the highest value
  -Infinity if no arguments are given. Math.max()
  NaN if one of the arguments is not a number. Math.max(1,"a") Math.max([1,2])
  function findMaxNumber(arr) {
  return Math.max(…arr);
  };
  -spread opt
  console.log(typeof [1, 2]); // Output: "object"
  console.log(typeof [...[1, 2]]); // Output: "object"
  console.log(Array.isArray([1, 2])); // Output: true
  console.log(Array.isArray([...[1, 2]])); // Output: true
  console.log([...[1, 2]]); => ...[1, 2] = [1, 2]
  console.log(...[1, 2]) == console.log(1, 2); output 1 2
  The spread syntax expands the array into individual elements.
  It prints each element of the array separately, with a space in between.
  const spreadArray = ...[1, 2]; syntax error
  -compare two strings
  you can use the localeCompare method or the equality operators (=== or ==)
  "a".localeCompare("f"); -1
  "f".localeCompare("a"); 1
  "f".localeCompare("f"); 0
  "apple" == "apple" true
  "apple" == "apples" false
  "apple" === "apple" true
  "apple" === "apples" false
  -[1,2,3,4,[99,11,[12,44,34,442]]]
  console.log(arr.flat()); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 99, 11, Array(4)]
  console.log(arr.flat().flat()); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 99, 11, 12, 44, 34, 442]
  console.log(arr.flat(Infinity)); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 99, 11, 12, 44, 34, 442]
  console.log(Math.max(...arr.flat(Infinity))); //442
