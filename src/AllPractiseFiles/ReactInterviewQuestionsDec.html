-shallow comparison vs deep comparison in js and in react???
-So, in summary, state variables established with useState persist across re-renders, and
their values are updated based on calls to the corresponding set functions.
They don't automatically reset to their default values during each re-render.
The default values are used only during the initial render to set up the initial state.
-react lazy
React.lazy is an API for code-splitting in React. It allows you to load a React component lazily, meaning
that the component is only loaded when it's actually needed. This can help improve
the initial loading performance of your application by splitting your code into smaller chunks.
When you use React.lazy, it returns a dynamic
import() statement that fetches the component on demand. This import() statement returns a Promise.
const MyLazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent'));
const MyParentComponent = () => (
<React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <MyLazyComponent />
</React.Suspense>
);
React.lazy(() => import('./MyLazyComponent')) returns a Promise that resolves to the module containing
the MyLazyComponent.
The React.Suspense component is used to specify a fallback UI while the lazy component is being loaded.
So, to answer your question, the loading of a lazily loaded component using React.lazy is asynchronous.
The component is loaded in the background, and the rest of your application can continue to render and
function while the lazy component is being fetched.
If you're using it without Suspense, it won't behave as expected.
_
JavaScript achieves asynchrony through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
-useeffect how not to get called first time?
If you want to skip the execution of useEffect during the initial render, you can use a simple boolean flag.
Here's a straightforward example:
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
const MyComponent = () => {
const [isInitialRender, setIsInitialRender] = useState(true);
useEffect(() => {
// Skip the effect during the initial render
if (isInitialRender) {
// Update the flag after the initial render
setIsInitialRender(false);
return;
}
// Your actual effect logic here
console.log('useEffect ran after the initial render');
}, [isInitialRender]);
return <div>Your component content here</div>;
};
export default MyComponent;
-how child component can call a function defined in parent component?
// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
const ChildComponent = ({ onChildButtonClick }) => {
return (
<button onClick={onChildButtonClick}>
  Click me in the child component
</button>
);
};
export default ChildComponent;
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';
const ParentComponent = () => {
const handleChildButtonClick = () => {
console.log('Button clicked in the child component');
// You can perform any other logic here
};
return (
<div>
  <h1>Parent Component</h1>
  <ChildComponent onChildButtonClick={handleChildButtonClick} />
</div>
);
};
-parent calls child component function
useRef and useImerptiveHandle and callback functions arguments for value grabbing as well
- state updates in React are asynchronous, and the new state may not be immediately available after calling setCount.
console.log("prev")
setCount((prev)=>prev+1)
console.log("next")
//
prev
next
console.log("next"): This line is executed immediately after the setCount line, without waiting for the state
to be updated.
It logs "next" to the console.
The useState hook returns an array with two elements:
The current state value.
A function that allows you to update the state.
-ensure next is consoled only after setcount updates state
<button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
const incrementCount = () => {
setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
};
useEffect(() => {
console.log('Count updated:', count);
console.log('next');
}, [count]);
-promise in js?
Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous operations
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an
asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
A Promise can be in one of three states:
Pending: The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.
example:
To access the result of a Promise in an API call, you can use the .then() method to handle
the successful resolution of the Promise. The result of the API call will be available as an
argument to the callback function passed to .then().
Additionally, you can use the .catch() method to handle errors if the Promise is rejected.
/ Function that returns a Promise for fetching data from an API
const fetchData = () => {
return fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
.then(response => {
// Check if the response is successful (status code 2xx)
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
}
return response.json();
});
};

// Using the fetchData function
fetchData()
.then(data => {
console.log('Data:', data);
// You can use the data here
})
.catch(error => {
console.error('Error:', error);
// Handle errors here
});
using Promise keyword?
The Promise keyword is used to create a new Promise object in JavaScript.
You can use the Promise constructor to wrap asynchronous operations and handle their
results using the resolve and reject functions.
Here's an example of using the Promise keyword for an API call:
const fetchData = () => {
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
.then(response => {
// Check if the response is successful (status code 2xx)
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
}
return response.json();
})
.then(data => {
// Resolve the Promise with the fetched data
resolve(data);
})
.catch(error => {
// Reject the Promise with the error
reject(error);
});
});
};
- array of promises and one after the other execution required
If you have an array of Promises and you want to execute them one after
the other (sequentially), you can use a combination of Array.reduce and the Promise.then chain.
This ensures that each Promise is executed in sequence, and
the next Promise starts only when the previous one has resolved.
// An array of functions returning Promises
const promiseFunctions = [
() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000)),
() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 1000)),
() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 1000)),
];

// Function to execute promises sequentially
const executeSequentially = async () => {
const results = [];

for (const promiseFunction of promiseFunctions) {
const result = await promiseFunction();
results.push(result);
}

return results;
};

// Using the executeSequentially function
executeSequentially()
.then(results => {
console.log('Results:', results);
})
.catch(error => {
console.error('Error:', error);
});
The executeSequentially function uses a for...of loop to iterate over each Promise-generating function in the array.
It awaits each Promise to ensure they are executed sequentially.
The then method is used to handle the results when the Promise returned by executeSequentially resolves.

-shallow copy and deep copy.
A shallow copy creates a new object, but it doesn't create copies of nested objects within the original object.
Instead, it copies references to those nested objects.
Shallow copies can be created using methods like Object.assign() or the spread operator (...).
// Shallow copy using Object.assign()
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, originalObject);
// Shallow copy using spread operator
const shallowCopy2 = { ...originalObject };
In the above examples, changes to b inside shallowCopy or shallowCopy2 will affect the original object's b as well.
A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects within the original object.
This results in a completely independent copy.
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));
Libraries like Lodash provide _.cloneDeep() for this purpose.
// Deep copy using Lodash
const _ = require('lodash');
const originalObject = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const deepCopy = _.cloneDeep(originalObject);
With a deep copy, changes to b inside deepCopy will not affect the original object's b.

-custom hooks return type?
No, a custom hook in React cannot directly return UI elements.
Custom hooks are primarily meant for encapsulating and sharing non-UI logic across components.
They are not intended to create or return React elements.
so mostly data
-copy object different ways? LATER...
Shallow copy creates a new object with references to the same memory locations as the original object.
This means that any changes made to the original object will be reflected in the copy.
Deep copy creates a new object with new memory locations for all of its properties and nested objects or arrays.
This means that changes made to the original object will not be reflected in the copy.
shallow copy, you can use the assign() method
const obj1 = {
a: 1,
b: 2,
};
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1);
console.log(obj2); // { a: 1, b: 2 }
deep copy, you can use the stringify() and parse() methods. The stringify() method converts an object to a
JSON string, and the parse() method converts a JSON string back to an object.
const obj1 = {
a: 1,
b: {
c: 3,
},
};
const obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
console.log(obj2); // { a: 1, b: { c: 3 } }
// Cloning the Object with Spread Operator
let cloneUser = { ...userDetails };
This is no longer referenced, meaning changing the object's value will not affect the original object.
- promise.all and promise then and promise hell?
Promise.all is a method in JavaScript that takes an iterable of promises and returns a single Promise.
This new Promise resolves when all of the provided
promises in the iterable have resolved, or rejects if any of the promises are rejected.
Promise.all(iterable);
The returned promise will be fulfilled with an array of the resolved values of the input promises
(in the same order as the input). If any of the promises in the iterable reject, the
returned promise will be rejected with the reason of the first promise that was rejected.
const promise1 = Promise.resolve('Hello');
const promise2 = 42;
const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
setTimeout(resolve, 1000, 'World');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
.then(values => {
console.log(values); // ['Hello', 42, 'World']
})
.catch(error => {
console.error(error);
});
The .then callback receives an array with the resolved values once all promises have been fulfilled.
If any promise in the array
rejects, the .catch callback will be triggered with the reason of the first rejected promise.

  console.log(true + 5)=6 -why only one dom element to be rendered in react? In React, the requirement to have a single
  parent DOM element returned from a component's render function is a rule imposed by the virtual DOM diffing algorithm
  used by React for efficient updates. When React renders a component, it creates a virtual representation of the DOM in
  memory, known as the virtual DOM. This virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. To optimize the update
  process, React needs a single root element in the virtual DOM to represent the component. which allows React to
  efficiently compare the old and new virtual DOM trees and calculate the minimum number of changes required to update
  the real DOM. If a component returns multiple top-level elements,makes it challenging for React to perform efficient
  updates, as it would need to reconcile multiple top-level elements separately. To work around this limitation,
  developers can use a common pattern called a fragment, which allows multiple elements to be returned without adding an
  extra node to the DOM. Fragments are a lightweight way to group multiple elements without introducing unnecessary
  nodes in the DOM. Here's an example: const MyComponent=()=> {
  return (
  <>
    <div>Element 1</div>
    <div>Element 2</div>
  </>
  );
  };
  -map vs filter
  map creates a new array containing the results of applying the
  provided function to each element of the original array.creating a new array with the same length.
  const newArray = array.map((element, index, array) => {
  // return transformed element
  });
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * num);
  // squaredNumbers will be [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num >2);
  // [false, false, true, true, true]
  filter returns a new array with only the elements for which the provided function returns true.
  creating a new array that may have fewer elements than the original array.
  const newArray = array.filter((element, index, array) => {
  // return true to include the element in the new array
  });
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
  // evenNumbers will be [2, 4]
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  console.log( numbers.filter((num) => num *num))
  //[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  Both map and filter do not modify the original array;

  -currying
  https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/currying-javascript
  Currying can be a powerful technique in JavaScript, and its usage becomes apparent in scenarios
  where partial application of functions or the creation of more specialized
  functions is beneficial. Here are a few common use cases for currying:
  1.Partial Application:
  Currying allows you to partially apply arguments to a function, creating a new
  function with some of the arguments preset.
  This can be useful in scenarios where you have a function with many parameters, and you want to
  reuse it with some default values.
  // Using currying for partial application
  function add(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
  }
  const curryAdd = curry(add);
  const add5 = curryAdd(5);
  const result = add5(3)(2); // Equivalent to add(5, 3, 2)
  console.log(result); // Output: 10
  2.Creating Specialized Functions
  -this keyword in JavaScript
  In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special keyword that refers to the current execution context or the object
  to which the current function belongs.
  The value of this is determined at runtime and depends on how a function is invoked.
  Global Context:
  When used outside of any function or object, this refers to the global object (in browsers, it's the window object).
  console.log(this === window); // Output: true
  function logThis() {
  console.log(this === window);
  }
  logThis(); // Output: true
  Function Context:
  Inside a regular function, this refers to the global object (window in browsers) or undefined in strict mode.
  Object Method:
  When a function is a method of an object, this refers to the object that owns the method.
  const person = {
  name: 'John',
  sayHello: function() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name + '!');
  }
  };
  person.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, John!
  Constructor Function:
  When a function is used as a constructor with the new keyword, this refers to the newly created instance of the
  object.
  function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
  }
  const myDog = new Dog('Buddy');
  console.log(myDog.name); // Output: Buddy
  Event Handlers:
  In event handlers, this often refers to the element that triggered the event.
  const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this); // Output: <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
  });
  Arrow Functions:
  Arrow functions do not have their own this. They inherit the this value from the enclosing scope.
  const obj = {
  data: 10,
  fetchData: function() {
  setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(this.data);
  }, 1000);
  }
  };
  obj.fetchData(); // Output: 10
  The value of this can be explicitly set using methods like call, apply, or bind
  to control the context in which a function is executed.
  -arrow vs normal function

  -Infinity if no arguments are given. Math.max()
  NaN if one of the arguments is not a number. Math.max(1,"a") Math.max([1,2])
  function findMaxNumber(arr) {
  return Math.max(…arr);
  };
  -spread opt
  console.log(typeof [1, 2]); // Output: "object"
  console.log(typeof [...[1, 2]]); // Output: "object"
  console.log(Array.isArray([1, 2])); // Output: true
  console.log(Array.isArray([...[1, 2]])); // Output: true
  console.log([...[1, 2]]); => ...[1, 2] = [1, 2]
  console.log(...[1, 2]) == console.log(1, 2); output 1 2
  The spread syntax expands the array into individual elements.
  It prints each element of the array separately, with a space in between.
  const spreadArray = ...[1, 2]; syntax error
  -compare two strings
  you can use the localeCompare method or the equality operators (=== or ==)
  "a".localeCompare("f"); -1
  "f".localeCompare("a"); 1
  "f".localeCompare("f"); 0
  "apple" == "apple" true
  "apple" == "apples" false
  "apple" === "apple" true
  "apple" === "apples" false

  console.log(arr.flat()); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 99, 11, Array(4)]
  console.log(arr.flat().flat()); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 99, 11, 12, 44, 34, 442]
  console.log(arr.flat(Infinity)); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 99, 11, 12, 44, 34, 442]
  console.log(Math.max(...arr.flat(Infinity))); //442
