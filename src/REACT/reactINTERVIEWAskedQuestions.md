whats manadorty in react while creating a list of components?
the key attribute -Useful for react to effeciently update the ui by uniquely identifying which items have been changed, removed or added.
why not index as key?
bcoz when an list(array) is modified then all the index of all the elements gets updated,so react may be rerendering more components unneccessarily.keys dont remain stable when index is used.
